    "This framework aims to generate a need score for each non-member university and select those with high need scores as potential members. Need scores are generated based on criteria related to the university's needs, such as expanding college access and building a more diverse cohort of students. Upon sorting non-member universities based on their need scores, the company marketing team can decide on the number of potential members as much as the capacity of their sales or customer relation team allows.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used three needs criteria in this notebook: access expansion, student diversity, and streamlining the admission process. The metric for expanding access was whether the university offers distance education. Two metrics were implemented to capture the needs for student diversity: diversity of gender and diversity of race of undergraduate students enrolled at the university. The metric indicating the need for streamlining the admission process was the number of undergraduate students enrolled. Ideally, we would use the number of undergraduate applications received by the university rather than the number of students enrolled. The more applications that a university admission department works with, the more likely it is to need a software system that helps them streamline the admission process. A list of 100 non-members with the highest need scores was generated in the sample code. The marketing team can customize the number of non-members in the list based on the sales team's capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prototype can be extended in at least three ways. Firstly, one can add criteria as well as metrics. For example, one can include the number of university programs, the diversity of financial aids, and trend-related metrics. Secondly, my sample code uses equal weighting for each metric. An extension could be an interactive dashboard in which the EdTech company’s marketing team can enter different weights based on their knowledge of the current state of the education industry. Thirdly, related to the interactivity noted earlier, a dashboard where the marketing team can pick and choose criteria and metrics for generating need scores could be useful. For example, the marketing team may use a different set of diversity metrics for universities that only accept one gender (i.e., women's colleges). The gender diversity metric for these universities would naturally be zero."
