# About

Universities purchase products that streamline their operations and facilitate learning. Educational technology (EdTech) companies that offer products or services to universities need to identify their target customers. Given the capacity of an EdTech companyâ€™s sales team, which universities should the company approach?

Randomly approaching universities may not result in satisfying new customers relative to the number of leads (i.e., close/rate ratio). I outlined three approaches using IPEDS data that an EdTech company can consider to improve its close/rate ratio.
